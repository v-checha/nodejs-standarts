# Code Standards

{% hint style="info" %}
Coding standards, also referred to as coding conventions or style guides, are sets of rules and best practices that developers follow when writing code. These guidelines aim to achieve several goals:

* **Improved Readability:** Consistent formatting and naming conventions make code easier to understand for everyone working on the project, especially new team members. Clear and concise code reduces the need for excessive comments.
* **Maintainability:** Well-structured code is easier to maintain and modify in the future. Consistent formatting helps developers quickly grasp the logic and purpose of different code sections.
* **Reduced Errors:** Following coding standards can help prevent common coding mistakes by promoting predictable code structure and practices.
* **Collaboration:** Shared coding standards ensure a consistent codebase across different developers, facilitating collaboration and code reviews.
