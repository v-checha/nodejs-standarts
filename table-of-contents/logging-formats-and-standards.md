# ðŸ“– Logging formats and standards

**Logging Formats:**

* **JSON:** A popular and machine-readable format. Each log entry is a JSON object with key-value pairs for details like timestamp, log level, message, and additional context data.
  * Example: `{ "timestamp": "2024-05-17T14:41:00.000Z", "level": "info", "message": "User login successful" }`
* **Structured Logs:** Similar to JSON, but uses predefined keys and structures for consistency. Often used with libraries like Pino or Winston.
  * Example: `info: User login successful` (Pino format)
* **Combined Log Format:** A human-readable format with details like timestamp, log level, request method, URL, and response status code (often used with web servers).
  * Example: `127.0.0.1 - - [17/May/2024:14:41:00 +0000] "GET /users HTTP/1.1" 200 123`

**Choosing a Format:**

* **JSON/Structured Logs:** Preferred for machine-readable processing and analysis with tools or dashboards.
* **Combined Log Format:** Useful for basic debugging and human-readable log analysis.
* Consider your project needs and how you plan to utilize log data.

**Logging Levels:**

* **Define Standard Levels:** Establish standard logging levels (e.g., debug, info, warn, error, fatal) to categorize the severity and importance of logged messages.
* **Example Levels:**
  * `debug` - Detailed information for debugging purposes.
  * `info` - Informational messages about application events.
  * `warn` - Warnings about potential issues.
  * `error` - Error messages that may impact functionality.
  * `fatal` - Critical errors that cause application failure.

**Logging Standards:**

* **Consistent Formatting:** Maintain consistent formatting within your chosen log format across all log messages.
* **Contextual Information:** Include relevant context data in your log messages to aid in troubleshooting. This may include user IDs, timestamps, request IDs, and other details.
* **Log Rotation and Storage:** Implement a strategy for log rotation and storage to manage log volume and prevent disk space exhaustion. Tools like `winston-daily-rotate-file` can be helpful.

**Logging Libraries:**

* Utilize popular logging libraries like Winston, Pino, or Bunyan that offer functionalities like formatting, level control, and transport configuration.
* These libraries simplify log management and provide flexibility in configuring log outputs (e.g., console, files, external services).

**Benefits of Standardized Logging:**

* **Easier Debugging:** Standardized formats and levels make it easier to understand and analyze log data from different parts of your application.
* **Centralized Monitoring:** Facilitates centralized log collection and monitoring with tools like ELK Stack or Grafana.
* **Improved Observability:** Provides a comprehensive view of application health and performance.
