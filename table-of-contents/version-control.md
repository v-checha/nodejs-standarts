# ðŸ“– Version Control

**Centralized Repository:**

* Use a centralized version control system like Git for managing code changes collaboratively.
* Popular Git hosting platforms include GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or self-hosted options.

**Branching Strategy:**

* Implement a branching strategy to manage development workflows and isolate code changes.
* A common approach is to use a `master` branch for stable production code and create feature branches for development work. You can then merge approved feature branches into `master`.
* Consider using additional branches like `development` or `staging` for integration testing before merging into `master`.

**Commit Messages:**

* Write clear, concise, and informative commit messages.
* Use a convention like the Conventional Commits format ([https://github.com/conventional-commits/conventionalcommits.org](https://github.com/conventional-commits/conventionalcommits.org)) to structure messages consistently.
* Example: `feat: Implement user registration functionality` or `fix: Resolve bug in authentication logic`.

**Push Frequency:**

* Encourage frequent pushes to the remote repository to maintain a synchronized codebase and facilitate collaboration.
* Define an appropriate push frequency that balances keeping code up-to-date with avoiding overwhelming the repository with too many small commits.

**Pull Requests and Reviews:**

* Utilize pull requests (PRs) for proposing code changes.
* Implement a code review process where team members can review PRs before merging, ensuring code quality and adherence to standards.

**Version Tags:**

* Use Git tags to mark specific points in the development history, often corresponding to releases or deployments.
* Use semantic versioning ([https://semver.org/](https://semver.org/)) as a convention for version tags (e.g., `v1.2.3`).

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Resolve Conflicts:** Establish a process for resolving merge conflicts that may arise during collaboration.
* **Ignore Files:** Utilize a `.gitignore` file to specify files or directories that should be excluded from version control (e.g., `.env` files, node\_modules).
* **Version Control Hooks:** Consider using Git hooks to automate tasks like code formatting or linting checks before committing code.

**Benefits of Using Version Control Standards:**

* **Collaboration:** Version control facilitates collaboration by allowing team members to work on different parts of the codebase simultaneously.
* **Version Tracking:** Enables tracking of code changes over time, allowing you to revert to previous versions if necessary.
* **Improved Code Quality:** Code review process using pull requests can help identify and fix issues early on.
* **Deployment Management:** Version tags can be used to associate specific code versions with deployments.
